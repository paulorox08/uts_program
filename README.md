<ins>In business or technical terms describe your understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)? What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used.</ins>

Both continous integration (CI) and continous delivery (CI) are fundamental
practices of software development. CI is the practice of frequently merging 
changes back to the main branch which are validated by automated tests. It helps
avoid merge conflicts, duplicate code, and lessens the chances of bugs. CD 
builds on the practice of CI by deploying changes automatically to a testing 
and/or production environment. This allows the ability to produce software in
short cycles that are easy to troubleshoot. 

There are many options regarding tools for CI and CD. Some of the popular tools 
inlcude Jenkins, Buddy, and GitLab CI due to their ease of use, deep customization and features. Jenkins is a server-based CI application widely used
in software engineering for its ability to quickly automate builds and tests.
Buddy is more common in commercial settings for its ease to use interface and
design. GitLab CI is highly scalable and has many features that allow seamless project integration.
